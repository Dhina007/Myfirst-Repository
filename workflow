The Git workflow is divided into three states:


Working directory - Modify files in your working directory

Staging area (Index) - Stage the files and add snapshots of them to your staging area

Git directory (Repository) - Perform a commit that stores the snapshots permanently to your Git directory. Checkout any existing version, 

make changes, stage them and commit.
